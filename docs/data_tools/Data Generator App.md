#Data Generator App

_Cost:_ Free
_Type:_ Salesforce AppExchange App
_Level of Effort:_ If you are familiar with your org structure and creating related records, you 
likely can get several levels of related records created in under 3 hours if you are new to the app

##Summary 
[link](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000GBhE8UAL "Data Generator") is a declaritive app will quickly insert thousands of records customized to the unique shape of your Salesforce org.
It is a great start to getting some related records into your org. Itâ€™s not likely to have all the possible variations
of data you want, but if you start with the right parent record, are OK doing multiple runs and a bit of trial and error, this 
is a great declaritive tool to get started with. 

##Notes
- Limit of 10000 records per run
- Creates fake, related data based on your org and your inputs
- Works with custom objects
- Reads your metadata to determine available fields/objects
- No error messages when expected records are not created
- AppExchange listing says that you can delete a run, but I see no option to be able to do that
- If validation rules are hit (and possibly duplicate rules as well), it will stop the run. Suggestion is to turn off relevant duplicate rules with a tool like Salesforce Switch from cloudtoolkit.co
- It is very important to understand org model so that you start with the right parent as you can go down to a child record, but not up to a parent record
- You can reuse and modify previous runs
- Does not handle junction objects well given the hierarchical nature of the design
