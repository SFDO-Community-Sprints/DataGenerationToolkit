### Proof of Concept Code:

During the course of this project some ideas have been tested in code, and to ensure that code isn't lost and doesn't confuse other efforts in this repo they are kept in the proofs-of-concept directory.

Currently those include:

1. [A CumulusCI Task](proofs-of-concept/OriginalCciTask) created during this project's first sprint to generate permutations of data.
1. [A web-based Snowfakery recipe editor](proofs-of-concept/SnowmakeryEditor) created during the fall 2020 virtual sprint. This was the second tool named Snowmakery and largely confirmed that this project's UI will bare that name.

### Past Project Accomplishments

- *Between Feb '21 Virtual Sprint and present*
  - Moved Snowfakery recipe cookbook into an independent, community maintained repo
  - Designed Meeting in a Box for User Group and Conference presentations on sandbox seeding
  - Defined use case for seeding a sandbox with a Flow
  - Scheduled quarterly, public Snowfakery trainings
- *Between Sept '20 Virtual Sprint and Feb '21 Virtual Sprint*
  - Completed first full draft of Data Generation Guide document; including technical edit
  - Kicked the tires on Snowfakery, for real
  - Made several public presentations
  - Implemented Project Boards to track issues and discussion topics
  - Survived despite pandemic, fascism, etc.
- *9/23/20-9/24/20 Virtual Sprint*
  - Drafted architecture diagrams for a UI to sit on top of Snowfakery. This will be called _Snowmakery!_ There are two proof of concepts that have been initiated. One is inside of the org, the other is in Heroku.
  - Analyzed survey data from 75 community members; updated relevant Personas based on survey insights
  - Established document outline and Admin Story for documentation project that describes how to Generate Data and Move Data between orgs
  - Documented limitations and considerations for Partial Data sampling algorithm and manual steps, third party apps, and code for creating mock data records
  - Documented steps for an Admin-audience to use CCI to move data records from one Dev Sandbox to another Dev Sandbox (or any two persistent orgs)
  - QA-ed documentation steps for CCI steps (referenced above)
- *3/31/20 -> 4/1/20 virtual sprint*
  - Determined that Snowfakery accomplishes many of the original requirements brainstormed at the Philly Sprint (fall 2019) (namely: ability to generate mock data with related tables, random names and values, standard and custom objects, datasets of any size/scale, ability to populate Salesforce orgs)
  - Socialized Snowfakery to community members
  - Onboarded project leadership from multiple orgs and began application for inclusion in Open Source Commons program
  - Refined use cases and differentiated Snowfakery from (1) existing tools in the market (2) proprietary tools at Salesforce (3) Full Sandbox product
  - Brainstormed 2+ potential directions for extending Snowfakery to include an admin-friendly web interface
  - Reviewed documentation and install steps
  - Overhauled ReadMe file
